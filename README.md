# Thermoelectric Economic Dispatch Optimization

This repository contains implementations of non-linear optimization algorithms for solving the Thermoelectric Economic Dispatch (TEED) problem. The models are built using the Pyomo optimization framework and leverage solvers such as IPOPT and SCIP.

## Features

- **Optimization Framework**: Pyomo is used for modeling the TEED problem.
- **Solvers**: The project utilizes IPOPT and SCIP for solving non-linear optimization problems.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pyomo`
- Optimization solvers:
  - [IPOPT](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/)
  - [SCIP](https://scipopt.org/)
